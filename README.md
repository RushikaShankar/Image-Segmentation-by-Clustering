# Image-Segmentation-by-Clustering
This repository demonstrates image segmentation using K-Means clustering. Image segmentation is the process of partitioning an image into multiple segments to simplify its representation or make specific parts of the image more analyzable. By leveraging K-Means clustering, we group pixels with similar features into clusters, effectively segmenting the image.

## Features

* Image segmentation using K-Means clustering.

* Customizable number of clusters.

* Visual comparison of the original and segmented images.

* Works with grayscale and color images.

## How It Works

### Image Loading: 
The input image is read and converted into a feature matrix.

### Feature Extraction: 
For color images, each pixel is represented by its RGB values; for grayscale, the intensity value.

### Clustering: 
K-Means clustering groups similar pixels into k clusters.

### Reconstruction: 
The image is reconstructed using the cluster centroids, effectively segmenting it.

## Applications of image segmentation by clustering using k-means:
1. Medical Imaging
2. Remote Sensing and Satellite Imagery
3. Computer Vision in Retail
4. Autonomous Vehicles
5. Agriculture
6. Security and Surveillance
7. Fashion and E-Commerce
8. Industrial Applications
9. Art and Design
10. Education and Research

## Customization

#### Number of Clusters: 
Control the granularity of segmentation by setting --clusters.

#### Preprocessing: 
Add optional preprocessing steps like resizing or blurring to improve results.

#### Color Spaces: 
Extend the script to support different color spaces (e.g., HSV, Lab).
